description: Port Skyrim SE SPELL and magic mods into Enderal SE. Use after skyrim-to-enderal-porter has cleared the generic kill-checks, for everything magic-specific — renaming the five schools and the Elder Scrolls gods out of the strings, distributing spell tomes and scrolls through Enderal's own lists and merchants, repricing onto Enderal's economy, and making self-heals pay Arcane Fever. Every rule here was paid for by the Apocalypse port.

You port **spell and magic mods into Enderal: Forgotten Stories (SE)**. Read `CLAUDE.md` first for
the workspace's ground truth, tool paths and guardrails.

**Run `skyrim-to-enderal-porter` first.** It owns the generic kill-checks — `HEDR` form version,
does-it-load, SKSE builds, masters, worldspace collisions, patch-vs-replacement. Do not repeat them
here; if that triage has not happened, stop and do it, because a magic mod at `HEDR` 1.71 is invisible
and every hour you spend on its spell strings is wasted.

This file is everything that is **specific to magic**. Worked example throughout: the Apocalypse
conversion — `src/Apocalypse/` and its generators in `src/Apocalypse/tools/`, which live in the
[`enderal-mods`](https://github.com/stefangouldson/enderal-mods) repo rather than here. Every rule
below was paid for by that port; you do not need the checkout to follow them.

## The good news, first

**Enderal's five magic schools are renamed vanilla ActorValues — nothing else.** Same `MagicSkill`,
same magicka costs, same skill scaling, same perk-driven cost reductions. A ported spell's
**mechanics work unchanged and need no conversion at all.**

| Vanilla `MagicSkill` | Enderal discipline | Higher school |
|---|---|---|
| Destruction | **Elementalism** | (an art of its own) |
| Conjuration | **Entropy** | Sinistra |
| Restoration | **Light Magic** | Thaumaturgy |
| Alteration | **Mentalism** | Thaumaturgy |
| Illusion | **Psionics** | Sinistra |

**Alteration is Mentalism and Illusion is Psionics.** The intuitive pairing (Illusion→Mentalism) is
wrong and mis-files every spell in the mod. Check this every time; it reads correctly either way.

So leave damage, cost, duration, cooldowns and scaling exactly as the author wrote them. What breaks
is everything **user-visible** and everything about **how the player gets the spell**.

---

## 1. Distribution — assume it is dead until proved otherwise

**Enderal has no spell tomes at all.** It teaches spells from its own `_01E_SpellBook*` Book records,
fed by its own leveled lists. A ported mod's tomes have nowhere to land until you put them somewhere.

Worse, its distribution almost certainly targets records that do not exist. Apocalypse runs a
`StartGameEnabled` quest copying three FormLists into **54 vanilla vendor and loot leveled lists** —
**not one exists in Enderal**. The quest runs, copies nothing into nothing, and reports success.

Enderal's real slots **[verified]**:

| Purpose | Lists | Level bands |
|---|---|---|
| Spell books, vendor | `_00ETraderSpellBooksLevelA/B/C/D` = `118209` / `11820A` / `1376C8` / `14479B` | 1–12 / 1–18 / 14–40 / 30–55 |
| Spell books, loot | `_00E_SpellBooksLootA/B/C/D` = `13798C` / `13798D` / `1447A2` / `1447A3` | 1–7 / 10–18 / 18–33 / 30–55 |
| Scrolls, loot | `00E_ScrollsLowChance` = `0905A5` | 1+, `ChanceNone: 0.5` |

**Inject, don't rewrite.** Add entries pointing at your own sublist; carry every existing entry
through untouched. Forgotten Stories overrides eight of those lists — **build from the FS record, not
base Enderal's**, or you silently revert FS's edits. Diff your result against the winner: it must be
pure `+N`, never `-1`.

### Leveled lists have a ceiling, and spell mods hit it

A list picks **one entry per draw**, so one injected entry gives your whole sublist one *slot's*
odds — not one item's. Apocalypse's 160 tomes behind a single slot in a 15-entry list meant ~1 tome at
the game's richest spell vendor and usually none at the smaller ones.

Weighting helps (`06-weight-distribution.ps1` duplicates the injected entry, which touches none of
Enderal's own). Two traps found by measuring: **`ChanceNone` does not dilute your share** — it gates
whether the list yields anything at all, so loot lists need the same weight as vendor lists, not less.
And **weight per host list, not per injection** — a band admitting one of your ranks where others
admit two ends up on half the share.

But weighting **cannot make an item findable**, only available. Which tome a shop has stays random
every restock, so with a large spell list most remain purchasable nowhere even at a healthy share.

**If the player must be able to go and buy a named spell, place it directly** — write the tome into a
named merchant's `Container` record as an ordinary `Items:` entry. Deterministic, restocks forever,
and tellable. Enderal's spell merchants, ranked by chest gold (the natural wealth ladder for tiering)
**[verified]**:

| Chest | FormKey | Gold | Shop |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_00E_Merchant_CCFunkentanz` | `102AD5` | 1800 | Ark, Emberlord and Fireflash |
| `_00E_Merchant_STTurious` | `118050` | 1430 | Sun Temple, Torius Flameling |
| `_00E_Merchant_UC_Barnabas` | `13824A` | 1050 | Undercity, Barnabas |
| `_00E_Merchant_CCSteinschlag` | `0F9320` | 980 | Ark, Ora Stonehand |
| `_00E_Merchant_MaxusTabbakus02` | `022BF2` | 620 | Duneville, Maxus Tabbakus |
| `_00E_Merchant_CCMilbert` | `127928` | 530 | Ark, Milbert Foxhand |

Direct placement for vendors, leveled lists for loot: shops should be a shopping route, loot should
stay random.

**Check what else overrides the chest before claiming it.** `KataPUMBSpellPack.esp` adds the same 15
staves to `CCFunkentanz`, `STTurious` and `FlusshaimTarhutieContainer`, and those are their only
vendor. Overriding one without mastering it deletes them. Where a mod repeats an identical set across
several chests, **sparing one preserves the whole set** — which is why Apocalypse leaves Tarhutie
alone and uses Maxus Tabbakus (620) instead of Tarhutie (630).

Two things that make working distribution look broken: vendor stock is **cached in the save**
(`iDaysToRespawnVendor: 2`), and `player.additem <LVLI FormID> 1` **resolves a leveled list on the
spot** — that is how you prove distribution without waiting or starting a new game.

## 2. Prices — Enderal's scale is far flatter than Skyrim's

**[verified]** Enderal's *entire* spell-tome range is **20–350**, with two outliers (Paralyze Rank II
400, the unique Death Storm 600). Scrolls run **10–100** with two at 500. Vanilla Skyrim's tome ladder
is ~50/175/330/700/1300 and a ported mod carries it in silently — Apocalypse's masters sat at a 1407
median, 5.6× Enderal's dearest tome. For scale, Enderal's *unique weapons and armour* run 1100–4000,
so a Skyrim-priced master tome costs about what a unique greataxe does.

Rescale by a **per-tier ratio**, not a flat value, so the author's ordering inside each tier survives.
Let tiers overlap at the edges — Enderal's own do. See `08-reprice.ps1`.

Leave **magicka** costs alone. Those are the author's balance and they work unchanged.

## 3. Arcane Fever — the one mechanic a ported healing spell must join

**Enderal taxes healing MAGIC, not healing.** **[verified 2026-08-03]** It *does* have healing
potions — five tiers of `_NNE_Genesungstrank` (`01E` `0028C8` → `05E` `0028C9`, 36 → 160 HP over 4 s,
25 → 190 gold) plus `_00E_Medicine` `07071F` — and **not one of them raises Arcane Fever**. What pays
Fever is *casting*: all 11 of Enderal's 837 fever-raising spells are self-heals.

So the design is a trade, not a prohibition: potions are the finite, gold-priced heal; healing magic
is the renewable one, and Fever is its price. **A ported healing spell that costs nothing is
inconsistent with every Enderal spell in its class** — and strictly better than the potions as well,
since it is free in both gold and Fever.

(Do not repeat the claim that Enderal has no healing potions. It is wrong, it was asserted in this
repo once from an English-only name search — Enderal's EditorIDs are German, and `Genesungstrank`
renders in-game as *"Health Potion (Cheap)"* and friends.)

Fever lives in the negated `LastFlattered` ActorValue; at 100 you die (`_00E_EPUpdateFunctions` polls
it, warns at ≥90, `Player.Kill()` at 100). Only **11 of Enderal's 837 spells** raise it and **every
one is a self-heal** — so a ported master *damage* spell costing nothing is **correct**, not a gap.

Two effects. Pick by cast type:

| MGEF | FormKey | Use on |
|---|---|---|
| `_00E_IncreaseArcaneFeverFFSelf` | `11A4B6:Skyrim.esm` | FireAndForget and Scroll casts. Script archetype → `_00E_ArkanistenfieberBlitzheilungSCN` |
| `_00E_IncreaseArcaneFeverConcSelf` | `106EA4:Skyrim.esm` | Concentration casts only. `Archetype: ActorValue → LastFlattered` |

Append as the **last** effect item, so existing indices don't shift (mod scripts read them):

```yaml
- BaseEffect: 11A4B6:Skyrim.esm
  Data:
    Magnitude: 5
    Duration: 1
```

`11A4B6`'s script reads **`Self.GetMagnitude()`** — the effect item's `Magnitude`. (The *potion* path,
`_00E_FS_AlchAddArcaneFever`, reads `Area` instead. Do not mix them up.) It also applies the **Mental
Expert** reduction itself (`×0.67` with perk `069D07`), so records using it need no perk condition.

The Concentration path cannot self-scale, so Enderal gates it at the spell level instead — `106EA4`
at full magnitude conditioned `HasPerk 069D07` with **no `ComparisonValue`** (implicit 0 = lacks the
perk), plus FS's `02F42E` at 0.68× conditioned `ComparisonValue: 1`. Copy the shape from
`_40E_SpellBoon 12E165` verbatim.

### How much

Enderal charges a **flat** cost per line — every FlashHeal 5, every Boon 0.5/s — so HP-per-point
*improves* with tier. Price against its ceilings and never beat them:

| | Ceiling | From |
|---|---|---|
| Burst | **26 HP per fever point** | `_55E_SpellFlashHeal 12E168`, 130 HP / 5 |
| Over-time | **78 HP per fever point** | `_40E_SpellBoon 12E165`, 39 HP/s ÷ 0.5/s |
| Floors | **5** spells, **2.5** scrolls | `_07E_SpellFlashHeal`, `01E_ScrollBoon` |

Both are the *un-perked* figures; with Ambrosia (`069D05`) Enderal's own rise to 30 and 92, so
pricing at 26/78 keeps the port below Enderal either way. `09-arcane-fever-heals.ps1` implements this
and asserts every rate stays inside the ceiling.

### Three traps

- **`11A4B6` is Self-delivery.** A Self MGEF on an `Aimed` spell has **zero precedent across 370
  non-Self spells** in Enderal, FS and Apocalypse combined — it builds clean, passes xEdit, and does
  nothing. So **leech/drain heals cannot be taxed this way.** Leaving them untaxed is defensible
  (they're conditional combat rewards, and variable ones have no number to price). If they must be
  taxed, the only shape with precedent is a *new Aimed MGEF* carrying the same script, which charges
  on `akCaster == PlayerREF`.
- **Tax only what actually heals.** If the heal effect is conditional (`Health < 0.5`), copy that
  condition onto the fever effect too — copy it, never retype it — or the spell charges for nothing.
- **Tax where the healing is.** A spell whose parent effect is a script that *casts* the real heal
  (Apocalypse's Breath of Tyr channels, then casts one of ten `_Level` spells) must be taxed on the
  children, or a 0-second tap costs the same as a full channel.

**Prove it in-game.** Fever is stored negated, so a heal makes `player.getav lastflattered` *more*
negative. The control that proves the mechanism rather than a raw AV write: `player.addperk 069D07`,
reset, recast — the delta must drop to **0.67×**. If it doesn't, the effect isn't going through
Enderal's script.

## 4. Strings — rewriting Tamriel out of the mod

Mechanics port; **names do not**. The player has never heard of the School of Conjuration, Daedra,
Nirn, or any Elder Scrolls god. Rename in **every** place a name appears: the tome, the spell, the
scroll, the magic effect, the enchantment, the staff and the description text. `01-gen-renames.ps1`
does this as an ordered longest-first map so no pair is a prefix of another.

Enderal's magic vocabulary, for replacements: the **Sea of Eventualities** (mages "manifest an
eventuality"), the **Lost Ones** (its undead), **Sinistra** and **Thaumaturgy** (the two higher
schools), **Vyn** (the world), the **Light-Born** (its gods). Draw every replacement from Enderal's
own written lore rather than inventing — the source is `_00E_BookMagicDisciplines*` and the
`_00E_MagicSchool*` load screens.

Worked examples from Apocalypse: Mara→**Irlanda** (judgment), Meridia→**Malphas** (guardian),
Arkay→**Tyr** (father of the gods), Stendarr→**Erodan** (wisdom), Nirn→**Vyn**,
Oblivion→**Sinistra**/the Sea of Eventualities, Daedric→**Entropic**. Named Tamriel mages become
either an Enderal arcanist (Baledor, Girathû) or simply descriptive — do not credit spells to people
who were never spellcasters in this world.

### `(Rank N)` means something else here — do not add it

**[verified]** In Enderal that suffix is an **upgrade chain**, not a power tier: the same spell at six
strengths, prefixed by the player level it unlocks at (`_01E_`/`_10E_`/`_18E_`/`_28E_`/`_38E_`/`_48E_`
= levels 1/10/18/28/38/48). "(Rank I)" promises the player a Rank II exists.

Enderal leaves **13 of its 201 tomes unsuffixed** — precisely the spells that exist at one strength
only. A ported spell with one version belongs in that group. `Spell Tome: <name>` looks inconsistent
next to Enderal's and is the consistent choice.

---

## 5. Summons — no Daedra, no Dwemer

Cut them: Dremora, Xivilai, anything Oblivion-native, and Dwemer automatons. Apocalypse lost 15.
Removal means **never distributing** them — leave the records dormant rather than deleting, which
avoids breaking whatever points at them.

Everything else stays. Enderal's own magic raises the dead and binds spirits — **Entropy** is one of
its five disciplines — so wraiths, liches, totem spirits and necromancy are entirely at home. Only
the Oblivion natives have to go.

---

## 6. The rest of the checklist

- **Staff crafting is Dragonborn content.** Staff Enchanter bench and Heart Stones do not exist in
  Enderal, so staff recipes could never appear in any menu. Delete them — that also takes most of the
  mod's DLC references with them.
- **`MenuDisplayObject` is commonly a vanilla FormID Enderal lacks**, which is why ported scrolls
  often have no inventory preview. A dangling reference here is **harmless** (Apocalypse ships
  hundreds and runs). Prefer leaving it to inventing a replacement, and prefer consistency — do not
  strip a field from ten records when the mod's other 134 keep it.
- **Vanilla perks a mod gates on may be unobtainable.** `Respite 0581F9` exists as a record but is not
  on Enderal's `Player` NPC and there is no vanilla perk UI, so every `HasPerk 0581F9` effect item is
  permanently inert. Read magnitudes off the *un*-perked effect.
- **Never open a ported spell in the Creation Kit.** Unless the record carries `ManualCostCalc`, the
  CK recalculates `BaseCost` on save from the effect list — so adding a fever effect and then opening
  the record silently inflates its magicka cost. Edit the YAML only.
- **New perks are invisible.** Enderal has no vanilla perk tree UI; its talents are three-tier Perks
  paired with `WordOfPower` unlocks read through `_00E_TalentLibrary`. A mod that adds perks to
  vanilla trees puts them where the player can never see or buy them. Hang new behaviour off
  keywords, magic effects or Enderal's own perks instead.

## Report like this

Verdict first, then evidence — never a verdict from a name alone (guardrail 1).

```
SCHOOLS      : mapped, N spells  (Alteration->Mentalism, Illusion->Psionics confirmed)
DISTRIBUTION : <mod>'s targets N vanilla lists, M exist in Enderal -> rebuilt via <lists/merchants>
PRICING      : tome median was X, now Y  (Enderal range 20-350)
ARCANE FEVER : N self-heals taxed, rates <= 26 burst / 78 over-time; K leech spells left untaxed [why]
STRINGS      : N renames across tome/spell/scroll/MGEF/ench/description
SUMMONS      : N cut (Daedra/Dwemer), rest kept - Entropy covers undead and spirits
RANK SUFFIX  : none added [single-strength spells, matching Enderal's own 13]

UNVERIFIED   : ... say plainly what has NOT been proven in-game
```

A clean build is not a working port. Only launching Enderal proves it runs — and for magic
specifically, the two things a build cannot tell you are whether the tomes are actually **buyable**
and whether the fever effect actually **fires**. Both need the console.
