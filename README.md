# claudemodenv — a Skyrim mod-development template

A version-controlled workspace for building SkyrimSE mods as **text**. It uses
[Spriggit](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit) to convert Bethesda plugin files
(`.esp`/`.esm`/`.esl`) to and from human-editable YAML kept under git, and adds a command-line
Papyrus toolchain, a manifest-driven FOMOD build, GitHub Actions CI, and a set of Claude Code skills
and subagents that know how to drive all of it. **You edit the YAML, not the binary plugin.**

Use it as a GitHub template ("Use this template"), or clone it and start deleting. It ships with a
small working **`ExampleMod`** so a fresh clone builds something real before you have written
anything of your own — see [The example mod](#the-example-mod).

- **Game release:** SkyrimSE
- **Spriggit package/source:** `Spriggit.Yaml.Skyrim`
- **Spriggit version:** `0.40.0` (CLI)
- **Tool paths:** resolved from `.claude/config/tools.json` (gitignored, per-machine) — **no
  hardcoded paths in the skills.** See [Tool config & modlists](#tool-config--modlists) below.

## Fresh clone — first-run setup

Cloning brings the skills, agents, config **template**, and docs — but **not** machine-specific
paths or any large/derived content (those are gitignored). Do this once on a new machine:

1. **Create your tool config.** Copy the template to the gitignored real config:

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item ".claude/config/tools.example.json" ".claude/config/tools.json"
   ```

   You'll fill it in over the next steps (or let `modlist-install` populate most of it).

2. **Install the Spriggit CLI** (standalone — *not* part of a modlist). Grab it from the
   [Spriggit releases](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit/releases), install the .NET
   runtime if prompted, then set `spriggitCli` in `tools.json` to the `Spriggit.CLI.exe` path. See
   [Installing Spriggit locally](#installing-spriggit-locally).

3. **Install a modlist (optional but recommended).** Run **`/modlist-install`** — it walks you
   through the Wabbajack GUI install (needs a Steam-owned SkyrimSE), then auto-discovers the
   **game folder, Creation Kit, and Papyrus compiler** into `tools.json`. Skip this only if you'll
   point at a plain Steam install instead.

4. **Fill any remaining blanks.** After step 3 the installer reports which keys it found vs. left
   blank. Set by hand anything still empty — most commonly **Champollion** (`champollion`) and
   **BSA Browser** (`bsab`), which aren't always bundled in a modlist. Without a modlist, also set
   `gameRoot` / `papyrusCompiler` / `creationKit` manually.

5. **Verify.** Confirm the tools you need actually resolve:

   ```powershell
   . ".claude/config/tools.ps1"
   Assert-Tool $Tools.spriggitCli     'spriggitCli'
   Assert-Tool $Tools.papyrusCompiler 'papyrusCompiler'   # if you'll compile scripts
   $Tools | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4
   ```

   `Assert-Tool` throws on a missing/empty path — fix those before running the skills.

6. **One-time Papyrus source** (only if you'll compile): extract the base-game script source as
   described under [One-time setup](#one-time-setup-before-first-compile) — many modlists already
   ship it, so check `$Tools.gameSourceScripts` first.

You're set: serialize/deserialize plugins, decompile references and scripts for lookup, author your
own plugin + scripts, and package for testing — all without touching a hardcoded path.

## Installing Spriggit locally

[Spriggit](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit) converts Bethesda plugins to and from a
git-friendly text format so you can version-control mods like source code (diffs, branches, PRs).
It ships in two flavors:

- **CLI** (`Spriggit.CLI.exe`) — runs on Windows and Linux, scriptable, **requires a .NET runtime**.
  This is what this workspace uses.
- **GUI** — a Windows-only desktop app where you link a plugin to a folder and sync with a click.
  Same engine, friendlier for one-off conversions.

**Install (overview):**

1. Download a precompiled build from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit/releases)
   — grab the CLI zip (or the GUI installer) for the latest version. Unzip it anywhere.
2. Install the **.NET runtime** if prompted when first running the CLI.
3. That's it — there's nothing to register globally. Set the CLI path **once** in
   `.claude/config/tools.json` (`spriggitCli`); every skill reads it from there. If you move or
   upgrade the CLI, edit that one file — not the skills.

The serializer itself (`Spriggit.Yaml.Skyrim`) is a NuGet package that the CLI fetches on demand.
You don't install it by hand — the **`.spriggit`** file in this repo pins the package name and
version, so `deserialize` automatically downloads the exact serializer used to create the YAML.
This keeps everyone on the team producing byte-identical plugins.

For the full feature set (GUI walkthrough, merge-conflict tooling, supported games) see the
[Spriggit repo README](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit).

## Tool config & modlists

Every tool path the skills use (Spriggit CLI, `bsab`, Champollion, Papyrus compiler, Creation Kit,
game folder, MO2 modlists) lives in one place:

- **`.claude/config/tools.json`** — your machine's actual paths. **Gitignored** (it's per-machine).
- **`.claude/config/tools.example.json`** — committed template with documented keys. Copy it to
  `tools.json` and fill in, or let the modlist installer generate it.
- **`.claude/config/tools.ps1`** — dot-sourced by the skills (`. ".claude/config/tools.ps1"`) to
  expose `$Tools` (e.g. `$Tools.papyrusCompiler`) plus an `Assert-Tool` guard that fails loudly on a
  missing/empty path.

**Change a path? Edit `tools.json` — never the skills.**

### Installing a Wabbajack modlist (optional, big)

A Wabbajack `.wabbajack` file installs a complete, self-contained **MO2 instance** — its own copy of
the game, the mods, and the tools (frequently the **Creation Kit** and the Papyrus compiler). These
are **hundreds of GB**, so they are **gitignored** (`/modlists/`, `/downloads/`) and never committed.

Use the **`modlist-install`** skill: it walks you through the Wabbajack GUI install, then probes the
installed instance and writes the discovered paths (game root, Creation Kit, Papyrus compiler, BSA
Browser, Champollion, …) into `tools.json`. After that the whole toolchain points at the modlist
with no per-skill edits. Install the list anywhere on a large drive; if you put it under the repo,
keep it in the gitignored `modlists/` folder.

## The round-trip workflow

```
.esp/.esm  ──serialize──►  YAML (committed to git)  ──deserialize──►  .esp/.esm
                 ▲                                                          │
                 └──────────────── you edit the YAML ◄─────────────────────┘
```

1. **Serialize** your plugin once to create its YAML folder.
2. Edit the YAML as text (and commit it).
3. **Deserialize** to rebuild the plugin.
4. Load the rebuilt plugin in xEdit / Creation Kit to verify before shipping.

## The example mod

`src/ExampleMod/` is a complete, working mod kept deliberately tiny — four records and one script — so
that a fresh clone builds and runs before you have written anything. It masters onto **`Skyrim.esm`
only**, so it works on a bare install with no other mods present.

It exists to demonstrate each layer of the pipeline exactly once:

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| **A new record** | `ExampleMod_ExampleBlade` (`000800`) — a weapon derived from vanilla `SteelSword`, reusing its mesh so no assets ship. |
| **An override** | `LItemWeaponSwordBlacksmith` (`09BC43:Skyrim.esm`) — the vanilla leveled list copied verbatim with one entry appended, so blacksmiths stock the blade. Note the filename keeps the **original master's** suffix. |
| **Papyrus** | `ExampleModStartupScript.psc` on a start-game-enabled quest — shows a notification and hands you the blade a few seconds after load. Exercises the committed-`.pex` contract. |
| **Packaging** | A `build/manifest.json` release entry and a minimal committed `fomod/`, producing an installable `.7z`. |

In-game you should see, on a new or loaded save: a notification reading *"Example Mod is running…"*,
the **Example Blade** in your inventory, a forge recipe for it (2 steel ingots + 1 leather strip, no
perk required), and blacksmith vendors stocking it.

**To start your own mod:** run **`/mod-new-plugin`**, which scaffolds the YAML folder, the manifest
entry and the FOMOD stub for you. Then delete `src/ExampleMod/`, the committed
`build/staging/Example Mod/fomod/` tree, its `build/manifest.json` entry and its `.gitignore`
exception — or keep it around as a reference until you no longer need it.

## What is committed vs. ignored

| Committed (your authored work)          | Ignored (`.gitignore`)                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Your own mod's YAML folder(s)           | Binary plugins (`*.esp/*.esm/*.esl`)                     |
| Papyrus source `src/<ModName>/Scripts/source/*.psc` | Compiled scripts (`*.pex`)\*, archives (`*.bsa`/`*.ba2`) |
| Each release's FOMOD stub (`build/staging/<release>/fomod/`) | Build output (`dist/`, `build/dist/`) and the derived `.esp`/`.pex` that `build.ps1` regenerates inside `build/staging/<release>/` |
| `.spriggit`, configs, README, CLAUDE.md | Vanilla/third-party reference decompiles (`/reference/`) |
|                                         | Editor/venv (`.vscode/`, `.venv/`)                       |

**You commit source, not build artifacts.** Your mod's YAML folder, `src/<ModName>/Scripts/source/*.psc`
and each release's `fomod/` are the source of truth. `build/staging/<release>/` itself is committed
(so it shows what the actual mod folder looks like), but the `.esp` and `.pex` files `build.ps1`
generates inside it stay ignored by the blanket `*.esp`/`*.pex` rules — only the `fomod/` subfolder
is real source there. `dist/` and the packaged `build/dist/*.7z` are ignored the same way, along with
large third-party/vanilla reference decompiles.

\* **One deliberate exception.** Compiled `.pex` are ignored by default, but a plugin that ships
scripts opts its `Scripts/compiled/` folder back in through an explicit `.gitignore` rule. CI cannot
run the Creation Kit compiler, so it packages the committed `.pex` as-is. This is the only build
artifact in the repo and it exists for that single reason.

## Per-plugin folder layout

Created automatically when you serialize a plugin:

```
src/<ModName>/<modFolderName>/
  RecordData.yaml        # plugin header: ModKey, GameRelease, masters, author, Stats.Version
  spriggit-meta.json     # { PackageName, Version, Release, ModKey }
  <RecordType>/          # one folder per record type: Activators, MagicEffects, Quests, Perks, ...
    <EditorID> - <FormID>_<PluginName>.esp.yaml
```

File naming is fixed by Spriggit: `<EditorID> - <FormID>_<PluginName>.esp.yaml`.

## Spriggit commands (CLI 0.40.0)

Flags below are verified against the installed version (`Spriggit.CLI.exe serialize --help`).
Paths/settings come from `.claude/config/tools.json` via `. ".claude/config/tools.ps1"`.

### Serialize (plugin → YAML)

```powershell
. ".claude/config/tools.ps1"
& (Assert-Tool $Tools.spriggitCli 'spriggitCli') serialize `
  --InputPath   "MyMod.esp" `
  --OutputPath  "./MyMod" `
  --GameRelease $Tools.spriggit.gameRelease `
  --PackageName $Tools.spriggit.packageName `
  --PackageVersion $Tools.spriggit.packageVersion
```

### Deserialize (YAML → plugin)

```powershell
. ".claude/config/tools.ps1"
& (Assert-Tool $Tools.spriggitCli 'spriggitCli') deserialize `
  --InputPath   "./MyMod" `
  --OutputPath  "MyMod.esp"
```

On deserialize, `--PackageName`/`--PackageVersion` can be left blank — Spriggit auto-detects
them from the folder's `spriggit-meta.json`.

### Decompiling reference masters (lookup only)

Serialize vanilla or third-party plugins into a **gitignored** `reference/<name>/` folder so
you can grep them for FormKeys without committing them:

```powershell
. ".claude/config/tools.ps1"
& (Assert-Tool $Tools.spriggitCli 'spriggitCli') serialize `
  --InputPath   "Skyrim.esm" `
  --OutputPath  "./reference/skyrimBaseGame" `
  --GameRelease $Tools.spriggit.gameRelease `
  --PackageName $Tools.spriggit.packageName `
  --PackageVersion $Tools.spriggit.packageVersion
```

## FormKey discipline

- New records use **this plugin's** name as the FormKey suffix.
- Allocate contiguous FormKey blocks per feature for readable diffs.
- **Always grep the whole workspace for a hex FormID before assigning it** (collision check).
- ESL-flagged plugins are limited to `0x800–0xFFF` — confirm before exceeding.

See `CLAUDE.md` for project-specific architecture, record templates, working guardrails and
gotchas — it is what a future Claude Code session reads instead of re-deriving your conventions.
See `arch-docs/skyrim-record-patterns.md` for record shapes that build cleanly and still do nothing
in-game.

## Papyrus scripts & packaging

Alongside the plugin, this workspace handles **Papyrus scripts** end-to-end on the command line —
extract them from archives, decompile to source, edit, recompile, and package a loose mod to test.

### Toolchain (paths from `tools.json`)

| Step | Tool | Config key |
|------|------|------------|
| Extract `.bsa`/`.ba2` | BSA Browser CLI (`bsab.exe`) | `$Tools.bsab` |
| Decompile `.pex` → `.psc` | Champollion | `$Tools.champollion` |
| Compile `.psc` → `.pex` | Papyrus Compiler (CK) | `$Tools.papyrusCompiler` |
| Open the editor | Creation Kit | `$Tools.creationKit` |
| Build `.esp` | Spriggit (see above) | `$Tools.spriggitCli` |

### Pipeline

```
.bsa/.ba2 ──bsa-extract──► .pex ──pex-decompile──► .psc ──(edit)──► .psc
                                                                      │
   dist/<ModName>/ ◄──package-mod──┬── .pex ◄──papyrus-compile────────┘
   (install in MO2 modlist)        └── <ModName>.esp ◄──spriggit-deserialize
```

### One-time setup (before first compile)

The base-game Papyrus **source** ships zipped. Extract it once to provide the vanilla `.psc`
imports and the user-flags file the compiler needs (many Wabbajack lists already ship loose source —
check `$Tools.gameSourceScripts` first):

- Extract `<gameDataDir>/Scripts.zip` → `$Tools.gameSourceScripts`
  (yields the vanilla `*.psc` + `TESV_Papyrus_Flags.flg`).

### Folder layout

```
src/                       # EVERY mod lives here — one folder per mod
  <ModName>/
    <ModName>ESP/          # Spriggit YAML — COMMITTED (source of truth)
    Scripts/source/*.psc   # .psc you author or clean — COMMITTED
    Scripts/compiled/*.pex # build output — COMMITTED via a .gitignore exception (see above)
dist/<ModName>/            # packaged loose mod (Data layout) — gitignored
  <ModName>.esp
  Scripts/*.pex
  Source/Scripts/*.psc
```

`src/` is the only place mod content goes, and it holds as many mods as you need side by side —
a main plugin plus its compatibility patches, for instance. Each gets its own `src/<ModName>/`
folder and its own release entry in `build/manifest.json`; `/mod-new-plugin` sets both up.

### Testing (manual, in an MO2 modlist)

The modlists under `$Tools.modlistsRoot` (`STD`, `LoreRim`, `Baseline`, …) — or a Wabbajack instance
at `$Tools.modlistRoot` — are Mod Organizer 2 instances. Use the **`mod-deploy`** skill rather than
copying by hand: it reads the destination from `tools.json` and then *verifies* the mod landed under
the exact expected folder name. A mod in a wrongly-named folder is invisible to MO2 and the game
runs happily without it, so the symptom looks like a broken record rather than a bad path.

Then in MO2: refresh, enable the mod and its `.esp`, set load order, and launch through MO2.
**A clean compile is necessary but not sufficient — verify the scripts actually run in-game.**

## CI build & release (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/build.yml` rebuilds every release archive on each push to `main` (publishing them
to a **timestamped pre-release**), and cuts a named GitHub Release when you push a `v*` tag. It runs
on a free `windows-latest` runner and is driven by **`build/build.ps1`** + **`build/manifest.json`**
(the plugin → release-tree mapping). The build script contains no mod-specific names — everything it
builds comes from the manifest, so adding a plugin means editing JSON, not PowerShell.

What CI does: download the pinned Spriggit CLI → `deserialize` every plugin's YAML into the
committed `build/staging/<release>/` (whose `fomod/` subfolder is already checked into git; only
the derived `.esp`/`.pex` are regenerated) → copy the committed `.pex` into that release's `Scripts/`
→ `7z` each release into `build/dist/*.7z` → attach the archives to a
GitHub Release (on `main`: a **pre-release** tagged `build-<UTC-timestamp>`, titled with the UTC
build time; on a `v*` tag: a normal Release named for the tag) → regenerate `arch-docs/build-report.md`.

**CI does NOT compile Papyrus.** The Creation Kit compiler + licensed base-game script source can't
run in the cloud, so each script-shipping plugin's compiled scripts are **committed** at
`src/<ModName>/Scripts/compiled/*.pex` (an explicit exception in `.gitignore`).

> **Contract:** whenever you change a `.psc`, recompile (`/papyrus-compile`) and **commit the
> updated `.pex`** — otherwise the packaged addon ships stale scripts. `build/build.ps1` fails the
> build if any `.pex` is missing, but it cannot detect a *stale* one.

Run the same build locally (uses the Spriggit CLI from `tools.json`):

```powershell
pwsh build/build.ps1              # full build -> build/dist/*.7z + arch-docs/build-report.md
pwsh build/build.ps1 -CheckFomod  # only verify manifest <-> fomod/ModuleConfig.xml parity
                                  # (also checks installer image paths resolve + aren't progressive JPEGs)
```

To release: `git tag v1.0 && git push origin v1.0` → the workflow attaches the archives to a new
GitHub Release named `v1.0`. The **`github-release`** skill automates the curated version-release
flow: changelog from the previous tag, promote the CI-built assets, clean up the `build-*` tags.

**PR test builds.** `.github/workflows/pr-build.yml` runs the *same* build on every pull request
(open/update) and attaches the archives to the PR as a downloadable **Actions artifact** named
`pr-<number>-test-builds`, plus a sticky comment linking to the run's Artifacts (download requires
being signed in to GitHub). Each push replaces the previous artifact; merging or closing the PR
deletes it and updates the comment. The shared setup+build steps live in the composite action
`.github/actions/build-mod-archives/` (used by both workflows), so the Spriggit version and build
invocation stay in one place. (Fork PRs get a read-only token, so the comment/delete steps only work
for branches pushed to this repo.)

### Gotchas

- **Decompiled source is a reconstruction**, not the author's original — expect auto-named
  variables, reconstructed control flow, and lost comments. Always recompile + test.
- **Missing-type compile errors** mean a referenced API's source (SKSE, SkyUI, MCM, another mod)
  isn't on the import path. Add its `Source\Scripts` dir to the compiler's `-i` list and record
  required imports in `CLAUDE.md`.
- For decompiled-source cleanup and compile-error fixing, use the `papyrus-script-engineer` subagent.

## Claude skills & subagents

This workspace ships Claude Code helpers under `.claude/` (committed, so they're shared). They
bundle the verified CLI path and flags so you don't retype them.

**Skills** (invoke with `/<name>`):

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `modlist-install` | Install a `.wabbajack` modlist (gitignored) and auto-discover its tool paths into `tools.json` |
| `mod-new-plugin` | **Scaffold a new plugin** — YAML folder + manifest entry + FOMOD stub, buildable from the first commit |
| `spriggit-serialize` | Serialize a plugin → its YAML folder |
| `spriggit-deserialize` | Rebuild a plugin from its YAML folder (+ xEdit/CK verify reminder) |
| `spriggit-decompile-reference` | Serialize a vanilla/third-party master into gitignored `reference/` for lookups |
| `formkey-check` | Scan the workspace (+ `reference/`) for FormID collisions or the next free block |
| `bsa-extract` | Extract/list files (e.g. `*.pex`) from a `.bsa`/`.ba2` (`bsab.exe`) |
| `pex-decompile` | Decompile `.pex` → editable `.psc` (Champollion) |
| `papyrus-compile` | Compile `.psc` → `.pex` (CK `PapyrusCompiler.exe`) |
| `package-mod` | Assemble `dist/<ModName>/` (esp + scripts) for MO2 testing |
| `mod-deploy` | **Deploy into an MO2 modlist and verify it landed** under the exact expected folder name |
| `xedit-audit` | Headless xEdit clean + "Check for Errors" pass on a built plugin |
| `github-release` | Cut a curated `vX.Y.Z` release from the CI-built assets and tidy the `build-*` tags |

**Subagents** (specialized agents with their own context):

| Subagent | Role |
|----------|------|
| `spriggit-record-editor` | Creates/edits Spriggit YAML records following the naming & FormKey conventions |
| `spriggit-formkey-auditor` | Read-only audit for collisions, dangling references, broken cross-record invariants, and in-game anti-patterns |
| `papyrus-script-engineer` | Cleans decompiled `.psc`, fixes compile errors, drives the extract→compile→package loop |

**Automatic checks.** `.claude/settings.json` registers a `PostToolUse` hook that runs
`build/Test-RecordYaml.ps1` after every edit to a Spriggit record file. It is a fast structural
check, not a YAML parse — tabs, BOMs, odd indentation, ESL FormID range, and whether the filename's
`<EditorID>`/`<FormID>` still agree with the contents. That last check catches a real class of
copy-paste bug: run it across a large plugin and it finds records whose EditorID was renamed but
whose filename never was. Run it by hand over the whole repo with:

```powershell
pwsh build/Test-RecordYaml.ps1
```

**Working guardrails.** `CLAUDE.md` carries a short list of rules distilled from real failures —
ground-truth before claiming, copy records rather than retyping hex, verify the deploy path before
blaming the records, a clean build is not a working mod. They are worth reading once even if you
never use Claude Code with this repo.
