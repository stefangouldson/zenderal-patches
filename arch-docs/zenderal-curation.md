# Zenderal — curation

What is in the list, why it is in the list, and what it cost. This is the human-facing companion to
`enderal-record-patterns.md`: that file is about *how* to write a patch, this one is about *why a
patch exists at all*.

> **Status: skeleton.** The structure, constraints and decision rules below are settled and verified.
> The **roster tables are empty on purpose** — fill them in as mods are actually chosen. An invented
> roster would be worse than none, because the first person to read it would trust it.

## The list in one paragraph

Zenderal is an Enderal: Forgotten Stories (Special Edition) modlist with three goals — **bug fixes**,
**modern combat**, and **modern visuals** — and one non-goal: it is not a total overhaul. Enderal is
a finished, authored game with its own balance, art direction and progression. Zenderal's job is to
remove the things that get in the way of playing it in 2026, not to turn it into a different game.
Every entry below has to answer *"which pillar, and what did it break?"*

## Hard constraints

These are properties of Enderal itself, verified against the install (see CLAUDE.md → "Enderal
ground truth"). They rule mods out before taste does.

| Constraint | Consequence for mod selection |
|---|---|
| Enderal SE is pinned to **SSE 1.5.97** (ships `skse64_1_5_97.dll`) | Every SKSE `.dll` plugin must be a **1.5.97 / pre-AE** build. AE (1.6.x) builds do not load. This eliminates a large share of modern Skyrim combat and UI mods outright, or restricts them to their legacy versions. **Check this first — it is the cheapest possible rejection.** |
| Enderal masters **only** `Skyrim.esm` + `Update.esm` | Any mod mastering `Dawnguard.esm`/`HearthFires.esm`/`Dragonborn.esm` needs its masters changed or is out. |
| **SkyUI is built into Enderal** | Never install SkyUI separately. UI mods that assume a stock SkyUI install need checking against Enderal's copy. |
| Enderal replaces **all light settings** (SureAI's own readme) | Skyrim ENB/weather presets are starting points, not drop-ins. Cutscene fades are the canonical regression. |
| Progression is **talents (3-tier perks + WordOfPower)** in a custom menu | Mods that add to vanilla perk trees are invisible to the player. See `enderal-record-patterns.md` §0.2. |
| Enderal overrides **55 vanilla script names** | Any mod shipping a `.pex` with one of those names will clobber Enderal's version. Check the filename against Enderal's script list before installing, not after. |

## Decision rules

1. **Pillar or out.** If a mod doesn't serve bug fixes, combat, or visuals, it doesn't go in — however
   good it is.
2. **Prefer the smallest mod that does the job.** A list's patch burden scales with how much each mod
   touches. A weapon-timing tweak that edits ten records is worth more than an overhaul that edits
   ten thousand and needs a patch against everything.
3. **Prefer mods already converted for Enderal.** An existing Enderal port has already paid the
   master/keyword/script-collision tax. Search Enderal's Nexus category before Skyrim's.
4. **Record the conversion cost.** If a mod needed a patch in this repo, its roster row must name the
   patch. A mod with an unexplained patch is a mod nobody can safely remove later.
5. **Balance is Enderal's, not yours.** Combat mods get tuned toward Enderal's numbers, not the other
   way round. Enderal's difficulty curve is authored around its talent system and its economy.

## Roster

One row per mod. `Patch` names the `src/<PatchName>/` folder in this repo that makes it work, or `—`
if it needed none.

### Bug fixes

| Mod | Version | Why | Patch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(none recorded yet)_ | | | | |

### Modern combat

| Mod | Version | Why | Patch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Relentless Sword SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114022) — johnskyrim | 1.0 | A craftable high-tier longsword in 1H and 2H, in Enderal's own dark-metal register. Small (34 records); overrides only two existing records — the Riverville Temple cell and one blueprint vendor list. | **RelentlessSword** | **Install for meshes/textures only — its own `.esp` must be disabled.** Install the **CORE** (runed) branch; the fire/ice glow intensity stays johnskyrim's FOMOD choice and is asset-only. The shipped plugin cannot load or function in Enderal on four counts, all fixed in the patch — see below. |
| _(none — original work)_ | — | Enderal's enemies effectively never drop potions, which makes sustained fights a resource-management problem solved at a shop rather than in the field. Nine records, ESL, no assets. | **EnemyPotions** | Level-banded restore health/mana/stamina on the three loot lists Enderal's enemies actually share — 353 base NPC records: every bandit tier and every Lost One. ~35% of covered enemies drop one potion. **Must load after any mod that touches enemy loot or leveled lists** — see below. |

**Why Enemy Potions exists, and what it deliberately does not do** (all verified against
`reference/base/`, 2026-08-02):

1. **The gap is real, not assumed.** `01E_Traenke` (`0028E3`), Enderal's main potion list, is
   referenced by **8** NPC records — seven are dead-body props. `01E_FS_ClutterUseful`
   (`02E68C:EFS`), the one list SureAI filled with all 15 restore potions *and* level-banded
   properly, is on **75 NPCs, all peaceful citizens and guards**. No enemy uses either.
2. **There is no scaffolding to patch.** Enderal has **zero `LeveledNpc` records** and **zero NPCs
   that inherit `Inventory` from a template** (652 carry `Template:`; none list `Inventory`). Loot
   reaches only the NPCs that explicitly name a list. Three lists cover the bulk of what you fight:
   `00E_MOB_Bandit` (`04C982`, 109), `_00E_FS_DeathItem_Human` (`02F32B:EFS`, 106) and
   `DeathItemDraugr` (`03AD7F`, 186) — union 353.
3. **Nothing is removed.** Appending to a leveled list *dilutes* it, so each of the first two lists
   is restructured into a `UseAll` parent holding a verbatim copy of its original body plus the new
   potion list, which resolve independently. `DeathItemDraugr` is already `UseAll` and is simply
   appended to. The pattern is Enderal's own — `LootSmokingPipePeaceweed1` (`04815B`).
4. **Two obvious targets are deliberately skipped.** `00E_MOB_BanditWeapon01` (`014EBA`) and
   `03E_MOB_SkelettWeapon01` (`090A14`) have no `Flags:` and no `ChanceNone:` — single-pick
   **weapon** lists. Adding a potion would spawn the enemy holding a potion *instead of a weapon*.
   `01E_Gold` (`0028E4`, the widest hook at 235 NPCs) is skipped because many NPCs stack it twice,
   making the rate uncontrollable, and it also sits on friendlies.
5. **Known scope limit, not a bug.** Magier (59), Vatyr (56), Arpsplitter (36), Skelett (98) and
   Hexe (12) carry hand-placed weapons with no loot list, so they get nothing. Reaching them needs
   per-NPC overrides — a large forward-compat burden against any future combat or enemy overhaul,
   judged not worth it.

**Removal is safe** mid-playthrough: already-generated corpses keep whatever they rolled.

**Why Relentless Sword needed a conversion rather than a patch** (all verified against
`reference/base/`, 2026-08-01):

1. Its `.esp` masters `Dawnguard.esm`, `HearthFires.esm` and `Dragonborn.esm` — no record actually
   references them, but Enderal does not load them. A patch cannot rewrite another plugin's master
   list, so the records had to be re-homed.
2. Every forge recipe used `WorkbenchKeyword: 0F46CE` (Skyforge) and `GetGlobalValue 0F46D1`
   (Companions questline). **Neither FormID exists in Enderal's `Skyrim.esm`** — the recipes could
   never have appeared. Now `CraftingSmithingForge` (`088105`) gated the way Enderal gates its own
   shadowsteel tier, copying **both** conditions off
   `_03E_RecipeWeapon_27_SwordOfTheRighteousPathForged`: `GetActorValue Smithing >= 50` **and**
   possession of a blueprint. The blueprint —
   `JS_CraftingPlan_RelentlessSword`, *"Blueprint: Relentless Sword (Handicraft 50)"* — is a
   `MiscItem` built from Enderal's `_00E_CraftingPlan_04E_SwordOfTheRighteousPathForged`, and one
   copy unlocks all six swords. It has two sources:
   - hand-placed on the noble shelf (`13476D`) in **Riverville Temple** (`FlusshaimTemple`), which
     is the only cell this patch overrides;
   - added at Level 30 to **`_00ETraderCraftingPlansC`** (`148ABE`), the vendor tier its Handicraft-50
     peers already sit in, so it is not lose-forever missable.
3. Damage was on Skyrim's scale (11 / 20), which lands near steel tier here. Retuned to parity with
   Enderal's shadowsteel tier — **23 dmg / crit 6** (1H) and **37 / crit 11** (2H), matching
   `_03E_27_SwordOfTheRighteousPathForged` and its greatsword. Weight, speed, reach, stagger and the
   1000 value are johnskyrim's, untouched.
4. Added six dismantle recipes (`InvisibleDismantling`, → shadowsteel) so the swords are not the
   only weapons in the game that cannot be broken down, plus the `WeapTypeMelee` keyword every
   Enderal weapon carries.

Everything else in the mod already resolved correctly in Enderal and was deliberately left alone —
including the **temper** recipes, whose `HasPerk 05218E` condition resolves here to Enderal's own
`_00E_Class_Phasmalist_P04_B_ArcaneSmith` ("You can improve enchanted armors and weapons"), which
means exactly what johnskyrim intended it to mean.

## Load order

Enderal's stock order is two lines:

```
*Enderal - Forgotten Stories.esm
*SkyUI_SE.esp
```

Everything else is Zenderal. Record the intended ordering **and its reasons** here as it settles —
"why does this sit below that" is the part that is expensive to re-derive, and the part LOOT cannot
tell you.

| Position | Plugin | Must load after | Because |
|---|---|---|---|
| last | `Zenderal - Relentless Sword.esp` | anything editing `FlusshaimTemple` (`015282`) or `_00ETraderCraftingPlansC` (`148ABE`) | It overrides both to place and stock the crafting blueprint. A mod that edits the Riverville Temple cell and loads after it will drop the blueprint from the shelf — the vendor entry is the fallback, but the hand-placed copy is the intended find. |

**Patches from this repo load last**, after everything they forward, or they are not forwarding
anything. See `enderal-record-patterns.md` §0.1.

## Known conversion hazards

Running list of things that have bitten a Skyrim→Enderal conversion. Add to it as they come up; each
entry saves someone a test cycle.

| Hazard | Symptom | Check |
|---|---|---|
| AE-only SKSE plugin | SKSE fails to load, or the game closes at the splash | Mod's file page lists a 1.5.97/SE build |
| Mod masters a DLC | Plugin doesn't load; changes simply absent | `MasterReferences` in xEdit (`-EnderalSE`) |
| Ships a `.pex` colliding with one of Enderal's 55 overridden vanilla scripts | Enderal behaviour subtly regresses elsewhere | Compare the mod's `Scripts/*.pex` names against Enderal's |
| Second copy of SkyUI | UI breakage, MCM oddities | Enderal already ships `SkyUI_SE.esp` |
| Skyrim ENB/weather preset | Washed-out lighting; **broken cutscene fades** | Run one story cutscene before signing off |
| Perks added to vanilla trees | Mod appears to do nothing | Enderal draws its own talent menu |

## Release process

Patches are built and released from this repo, not from the modlist. `main` produces rolling
pre-release archives on every push; a `vX.Y.Z` tag cuts a named release. See README →
"CI build & release" and the `/github-release` skill.

When the list ships a new version, note **which patch release it pins** — a modlist referencing
"latest" is a modlist that breaks when this repo moves.

| List version | Patch release | Date | Notes |
